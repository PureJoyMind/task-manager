# Task Manager
A simple Task Tracker made with vue 3 as part of a tutorial I saw to quickly get up on vue.
## Features
* Add/Remove Tasks
* Date and Time for Tasks
* Double click on tasks to toggle reminder on/off

## Project setup
You must have Vue installed locally:
```
# Use sudo if on linux 
npm install -g @vue/cli
```
Install dependencies
``` shell
npm install
```
### Backend Replication
Run this in a separate terminal:
```
npm run backend
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
